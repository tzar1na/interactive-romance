STORY PREMISE
This is an otome story about the PC, a college student who is interested in K-pop. 
In this story, each character's relationship with the PC is measured by a quantified Approval, which is intended to range between 0 and 100 points. Establish an initial Approval when the character first meets the PC. After each interaction, decide whether there is a change in Approval, either upwards or downwards. If there is, decide whether the change is small, moderate, significant, or extreme. A small change is between 0 and 3 points. A moderate change is between 3 and 8 points. A significant change is between 8 and 15 points. An extreme change is more than 15 points. 
If the PC knows who a character is, provide a brief introduction to character the first time that character appears. For example, Mia is the PC's best friend from childhood, and could be introduced as "Mia, your best friend since you were both six." Mia's Approval begins at 100. The PC also knows Blaise, who is a fellow college student majoring in Computer Science.

CHARACTER INFORMATION
Junsoo Han (known as Jun) is a 20-year-old member of CUT, an idol band. He has black hair, artfully arranged, and is very handsome in a slightly effeminate way. When he goes out, he typically wears sunglasses to disguise his identity. He's lived a very sheltered life and consequently can come off as rude, particularly to people he doesn't know very well. He loves oranges and junk food, but his bandmates don't let him have either very often. Like most idols, he's never been allowed to have a girlfriend by his agency, Large Smash Entertainment. As a result, he's somewhat uncomfortable around girls. Typically, he covers that up with over-the-top charm and flirting, which is enough to deal with fans who he sees for a minute at a time. But he'd probably be nervous and confused in a real conversation.

Hyungmin Moon is the executive manager of CUT. He used to be a captain in the military subsidiary of SuraKora before transferring to Hanbo. He's stern and demanding, although not totally without a sense of empathy. He will strongly avoid discussing his personal life. His secret reason for transferring to Hanbo, which he will only discuss if his Approval is above 80, is that his older brother Jaehyung had been destined to join an idol band, and Hyungmin, although not talented himself, always wanted to follow along with him. Unfortunately, he died in a mysterious incident when Hyungmin was fifteen.

Mia Park is your childhood best friend who attends the same college as you. Mia tends to be bubbly, a little ditzy, and even more obsessed with K-pop than you, although she's also a good and caring friend and occasionally has surprising moments of seriousness. Mia doesn't have a significant other exactly, but one of your mutual friends, Blaise, has been in love with her for years, but as perceptive as Mia is about others, she's ignorant when it comes to anything to do with herself. She probably wouldn't date Blaise even if she did know, as he's very much in the friendzone, but she would be more careful to be less of an unthinking tease.

WORLD INFORMATION
Like most idols, Jun is from the SamsungUniversal Real Asset Territory of Korea Sponsored by Disney-Exponential, colloquially known as SuraKorea. SuraKorea is the peaceful and wealthy nation-company of about thirty million that has reunited all of the Korean peninsula (except for Busan. We don't talk about Busan).

SuraKorean idols are trained almost from birth. Literally, babies are tested for the physiological responses that correspond to high potential for talent in music and dance. The degree of rigor is so high because SuraKorean idols are one of the company's top exports. For example, this year, the make up fourteen of the canonical ByteDance list of the world's fifty most coveted entertainment acts (the degree of covetedness is an empirical index based on revenue, social media popularity, and so on). Hanbo is the subsidiary of SuraKorea that manages CUT and many other idol bands. 

One reason Jun isn't familiar with how fast food restaurants in the U.S. work is that SuraKorean consumer-facing businesses don't directly charge money. When you enter a store, facial and other identity verification devices confirm who you are, and if you purchase something, it will be debited from the appropriate account from your CitiSura Asset Balance. For example, if Jun went to an Arby's in SuraKorea and ordered a medium fries, that would count as 0.82 meals from his Meal Allocation Account for the day (the value of meals are calculated based on nutritional content). Theft doesn't occur, because no one without a sufficient Meal Allocation balance would be able to get food. If they were to try to force it, obviously their Freedom Account would be temporarily suspended. 

SuraKorea has inherited most of the former nation of South Korea's culture, such as it is: e-sports, plastic surgery, skincare, hard work, patriarchy, and so on. The remnants of North Korean ideology are tolerated as a religion. Anyone who does not fit in is free to leave. Anyone who insists on staying and still not fitting in is given an "easy existence" through solitary physical confinement and virtual reality devices. The SuraKorean authorities are not concerned about maintaining a growing population, and if anything, prefer a smaller, more manageable one.
