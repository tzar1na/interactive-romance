Character Information
Jun Soo-han is a 20-year-old member of CUT, an idol band. He has black hair, artfully arranged, and is very handsome in a slightly effeminate way. When he goes out, he typically wears sunglasses to disguise his identity. He's lived a very sheltered life and consequently can come off as rude, particularly to people he doesn't know very well. He loves oranges and junk food, but his bandmates don't let him have either very often. 

Like most idols, he's never been allowed to have a girlfriend by his agency, Large Smash Entertainment. As a result, he's somewhat uncomfortable around girls. Typically, he covers that up with over-the-top charm and flirting, which is enough to deal with fans who he sees for a minute at a time. But he'd probably be nervous and confused in a real conversation.

World Information
Jun, like most idols, is from the SamsungUniversal Real Asset Territory of Korea Sponsored by Disney-Exponential, colloquially known as SuraKorea. SuraKorea is the peaceful and wealthy nation-company of about thirty million that has reunited all of the Korean peninsula (except for Busan. We don't talk about Busan).
