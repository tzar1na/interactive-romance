Scene 1 - Inside Arby's, 1am Tuesday
Scene Time: About 50 minutes. Maximum of 50 inputs.
Ending Conditions: If the cashier becomes sufficiently frustrated, she will call security and have the PC and Jun thrown out. Proceed to Scene 2. 
If the PC has paid for Jun's meal, they may choose to leave the Arby's voluntarily at any time. This proceeds to Scene 2.
If the PC colludes with Jun to escape without paying, proceed to Scene 2.
If the PC never closely examines Jun, he leaves without her realizing who he is and the story ends.
If Jun does not trust the PC, he will not agree to sit with her and the story ends.
Scene Overview: The PC is working on a paper for class late at night in an Arby's when she notices someone trying to get food without paying. The PC needs to look more closely at the person before she recognizes him. Once she recognizes him, explain that he is Junsoo Han, known as Jun for short, one of the members of the globally popular K-pop band CUT.
