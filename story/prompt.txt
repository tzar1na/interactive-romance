PROMPT
It's one a.m. and your paper's barely hit a hundred words. Eight dollars and seven hundred calories of tomorrow's regrets sits on a scratched-up brown plastic tray in front of you. Just as you start digging in, a commotion develops at the counter.

"Excuse me, sir, you have to pay for that," the cashier says. The customer she's talking to is a tall, slender guy, with black hair and sunglasses, in a white shirt and dark pants that look both anonymous and expensive. He has a greasy bag clutched in one fist.

"Charge it to the room," he replies, turning to go. 

"Sir, this is an Arby's," she says. Nice, how often does she get to actually use that line? "You can't charge it to the room."

He stares at her, apparently baffled. 

1. Offer to pay for him.
2. Ask what's wrong.
3. Keep observing the situation.
